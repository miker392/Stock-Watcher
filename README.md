# Stock-Watcher

This was just a project to learn Python. This is meant to be a stock dashboard. You add the stocks you want to keep track of and every x minutes the page will refresh and update with the latest stock information.

The secret settings file looks like this:
SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key'
TIINGO_API_KEY = ''tiingo_api_key
