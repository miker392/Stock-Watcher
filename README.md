# Stock-Watcher

This was just a project to learn Python. This is meant to be a stock dashboard. You add the stocks you want to keep track of and every x minutes the page will refresh and update with the latest stock information.

SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key'\
APCA_API_KEY_ID = ''Alpaca Api Key
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY = ''Alpaca Secret Key
